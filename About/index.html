      <p>
         My name is Euan Fitzpatrick. I'm a 23 year old student at <a href="Sait.com">SAIT</a>. I've spent the last few years living a pretty crazy life. I moved to Whistler when I was 19 without knowing anything
         about the town or anyone in it. I made some really cool friends who came from all around the world, Australia, England, Scotland, Germany, New Zealand. I developed a deep love for skiing as whistler was a hub for all things snow.
         I spent the last 2 summers planting trees which has been an amazing experience and probably the hardest this I've ever done or ever will do. 
         <br><br>My Hobbies include skateboarding, hiking, skiing/snowboarding, biking, camping, pretty much all things outdoors.
